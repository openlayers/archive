              Sponsoring OpenLayers
          </h1>
          <p class="sponsor-notice">
              Thanks for your interest in OpenLayers sponsorship!  In addition to the OSGeo project sponsoship option described on this page, we're launching a focussed <a href="https://openlayers.org/blog/2012/11/01/crowdfunding-openlayers-3/">fundraising effort</a> toward the development of OpenLayers 3.  Please find our <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/ol3">Indiegogo campaign page</a> or get in touch with us at ol3&#45;funding&#64;googlegroups&#46;&#99;om if you're interested in learning more.
          </p>
          <p>
              Development and maintenance of OpenLayers is supported by a core team of developers, who seek to maintain a high quality code base driven by the needs of their users and customers. The support and contributions of a wide variety of participants has fostered the development of a high quality library that is now the de facto standard for open source web mapping.
          </p>
          <p>
              However, there are many aspects of the project that do not receive the attention they should. Crucial tasks, such as writing documentation, offering ad hoc support to users, and processing of bug reports often receive less attention than would be desired - or, when the attention is given, it comes at the cost of time that might otherwise be spent improving the library. Meanwhile, many organizations have made an investment in using OpenLayers as part of their operations, but have not had a way to directly contribute to the success and long-term health of the project.
          </p>
          <p>
              In order to provide funding to support the maintenance, improvement, and promotion of OpenLayers, the Project Steering Committee (PSC) is seeking sponsors to provide financial support via the OSGeo Project Sponsorship program. Funds will be held by the OSGeo Foundation for disposition on behalf of the project, and disbursed at the discretion of the OpenLayers PSC.
          </p>
          <p>
              Sponsorship should not be seen as a way to control the development of the project directly, but rather a way of ensuring the longevity and overall health of the project, by funding work that is regarded as vital but otherwise undersupported by the contributions of developers using OpenLayers in their own projects.
          </p>
          <div class="section" id="goals-of-sponsorship">
              <h1>
                  Goals of Sponsorship
              </h1>
              <p>
                  The OpenLayers community has established high-level goals for the use of funds from sponsors. The PSC votes periodically to allocate funds according to these priorities. The PSC also periodically votes to revise these priorities.
              </p>
              <ol class="arabic simple">
                  <li>Make it easier for both JavaScript experts and also those just starting out to adopt and use OpenLayers.
                  </li>
                  <li>Make OpenLayers globally known as an easy way to build rich mapping applications.
                  </li>
                  <li>Expand the number of people contributing functionality and improvements to the OpenLayers code base.
                  </li>
                  <li>Make OpenLayers a more useful and higher quality web mapping toolkit by enhancing the library.
                  </li>
              </ol>

              <h1>
                  Sponsorship Uses
              </h1>
              <p>
                  The sponsorship funds will be spent to further the above goals by both funding tasks that receive less attention without direct support, and by funding work on more rote project tasks so that core contributors can focus efforts on library improvements.
              </p>
