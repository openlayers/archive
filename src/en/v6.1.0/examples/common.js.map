The projection determines the\n * coordinate system of the center, and its units determine the units of the\n * resolution (projection units per pixel). The default projection is\n * Spherical Mercator (EPSG:3857).\n *\n * ### The view states\n *\n * A View is determined by three states: `center`, `resolution`,\n * and `rotation`. Each state has a corresponding getter and setter, e.g.\n * `getCenter` and `setCenter` for the `center` state.\n *\n * The `zoom` state is actually not saved on the view: all computations\n * internally use the `resolution` state. Still, the `setZoom` and `getZoom`\n * methods are available, as well as `getResolutionForZoom` and\n * `getZoomForResolution` to switch from one system to the other.\n *\n * ### The constraints\n *\n * `setCenter`, `setResolution` and `setRotation` can be used to change the\n * states of the view, but any constraint defined in the constructor will\n * be applied along the way.\n *\n * A View object can have a *resolution constraint*, a *rotation constraint*\n * and a *center constraint*.\n *\n * The *resolution constraint* typically restricts min/max values and\n * snaps to specific resolutions. It is determined by the following\n * options: `resolutions`, `maxResolution`, `maxZoom` and `zoomFactor`.\n * If `resolutions` is set, the other three options are ignored. See\n * documentation for each option for more information. By default, the view\n * only has a min/max restriction and allow intermediary zoom levels when\n * pinch-zooming for example.\n *\n * The *rotation constraint* snaps to specific angles. It is determined\n * by the following options: `enableRotation` and `constrainRotation`.\n * By default rotation is allowed and its value is snapped to zero when approaching the\n * horizontal.\n *\n * The *center constraint* is determined by the `extent` option. By\n * default the view center is not constrained at all.\n *\n * ### Changing the view state\n *\n * It is important to note that `setZoom`, `setResolution`, `setCenter` and\n * `setRotation` are subject to the above mentioned constraints. As such, it\n * may sometimes not be possible to know in advance the resulting state of the\n * View. For example, calling `setResolution(10)` does not guarantee that\n * `getResolution()` will return `10`.\n *\n * A consequence of this is that, when applying a delta on the view state, one\n * should use `adjustCenter`, `adjustRotation`, `adjustZoom` and `adjustResolution`\n * rather than the corresponding setters. This will let view do its internal\n * computations. Besides, the `adjust*` methods also take an `opt_anchor`\n * argument which allows specifying an origin for the transformation.\n *\n * ### Interacting with the view\n *\n * View constraints are usually only applied when the view is *at rest*, meaning that\n * no interaction or animation is ongoing. As such, if the user puts the view in a\n * state that is not equivalent to a constrained one (e.g. rotating the view when\n * the snap angle is 0), an animation will be triggered at the interaction end to\n * put back the view to a stable state;\n *\n * @api\n */\nclass View extends BaseObject {\n\n  /**\n   * @param {ViewOptions=} opt_options View options.\n   */\n  constructor(opt_options) {\n    super();\n\n    const options = assign({}, opt_options);\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {Array<number>}\n     */\n    this.hints_ = [0, 0];\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {Array<Array<Animation>>}\n     */\n    this.animations_ = [];\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {number|undefined}\n     */\n    this.updateAnimationKey_;\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @const\n     * @type {import(\"./proj/Projection.js\").default}\n     */\n    this.projection_ = createProjection(options.projection, 'EPSG:3857');\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {import(\"./coordinate.js\").Coordinate|undefined}\n     */\n    this.targetCenter_ = null;\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {number|undefined}\n     */\n    this.targetResolution_;\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {number|undefined}\n     */\n    this.targetRotation_;\n\n    if (options.center) {\n      options.center = fromUserCoordinate(options.center, this.projection_);\n    }\n    if (options.extent) {\n      options.extent = fromUserExtent(options.extent, this.projection_);\n    }\n\n    this.applyOptions_(options);\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Set up the view with the given options.\n   * @param {ViewOptions} options View options.\n   */\n  applyOptions_(options) {\n\n    /**\n     * @type {Object<string, *>}\n     */\n    const properties = {};\n\n    const resolutionConstraintInfo = createResolutionConstraint(options);\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {number}\n     */\n    this.maxResolution_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.maxResolution;\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {number}\n     */\n    this.minResolution_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.minResolution;\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {number}\n     */\n    this.zoomFactor_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.zoomFactor;\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {Array<number>|undefined}\n     */\n    this.resolutions_ = options.resolutions;\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {number}\n     */\n    this.minZoom_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.minZoom;\n\n    const centerConstraint = createCenterConstraint(options);\n    const resolutionConstraint = resolutionConstraintInfo.constraint;\n    const rotationConstraint = createRotationConstraint(options);\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {Constraints}\n     */\n    this.constraints_ = {\n      center: centerConstraint,\n      resolution: resolutionConstraint,\n      rotation: rotationConstraint\n    };\n\n    this.setRotation(options.rotation !== undefined ? options.rotation : 0);\n    this.setCenterInternal(options.center !== undefined ? options.center : null);\n    if (options.resolution !== undefined) {\n      this.setResolution(options.resolution);\n    } else if (options.zoom !== undefined) {\n      this.setZoom(options.zoom);\n    }\n    this.resolveConstraints(0);\n\n    this.setProperties(properties);\n\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {ViewOptions}\n     */\n    this.options_ = options;\n\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Get an updated version of the view options used to construct the view.

The pre-defined properties are listed in this documentation as\n * 'Observable Properties', and have their own accessors; for example,\n * {@link module:ol/Map~Map} has a `target` property, accessed with\n * `getTarget()` and changed with `setTarget()`. Not all properties are however\n * settable. There are also general-purpose accessors `get()` and `set()`. For\n * example, `get('target')` is equivalent to `getTarget()`.\n *\n * The `set` accessors trigger a change event, and you can monitor this by\n * registering a listener. For example, {@link module:ol/View~View} has a\n * `center` property, so `view.on('change:center', function(evt) {...});` would\n * call the function whenever the value of the center property changes. Within\n * the function, `evt.target` would be the view, so `evt.target.getCenter()`\n * would return the new center.\n *\n * You can add your own observable properties with\n * `object.set('prop', 'value')`, and retrieve that with `object.get('prop')`.\n * You can listen for changes on that property value with\n * `object.on('change:prop', listener)`. You can get a list of all\n * properties with {@link module:ol/Object~BaseObject#getProperties}.\n *\n * Note that the observable properties are separate from standard JS properties.\n * You can, for example, give your map object a title with\n * `map.title='New title'` and with `map.set('title', 'Another title')`. The\n * first will be a `hasOwnProperty`; the second will appear in\n * `getProperties()`. Only the second is observable.\n *\n * Properties can be deleted by using the unset method.

The layer will not be\n * rendered outside of this extent.\n * @property {number} [zIndex] The z-index for layer rendering.  At rendering time, the layers\n * will be ordered, first by Z-index and then by position. When `undefined`, a `zIndex` of 0 is assumed\n * for layers that are added to the map's `layers` collection, or `Infinity` when the layer's `setMap()`\n * method was used.\n * @property {number} [minResolution] The minimum resolution (inclusive) at which this layer will be\n * visible.\n * @property {number} [maxResolution] The maximum resolution (exclusive) below which this layer will\n * be visible.\n * @property {import(\"../render.js\").OrderFunction} [renderOrder] Render order. Function to be used when sorting\n * features before rendering. By default features are drawn in the order that they are created. Use\n * `null` to avoid the sort, but get an undefined draw order.\n * @property {number} [renderBuffer=100] The buffer in pixels around the tile extent used by the\n * renderer when getting features from the vector tile for the rendering or hit-detection.\n * Recommended value: Vector tiles are usually generated with a buffer, so this value should match\n * the largest possible buffer of the used tiles. It should be at least the size of the largest\n * point symbol or line width.\n * @property {import(\"./VectorTileRenderType.js\").default|string} [renderMode='hybrid'] Render mode for vector tiles:\n *  * `'image'`: Vector tiles are rendered as images. Great performance, but point symbols and texts\n *    are always rotated with the view and pixels are scaled during zoom animations. When `declutter`\n *    is set to `true`, the decluttering is done per tile resulting in labels and point symbols getting\n *    cut off at tile boundaries.\n *  * `'hybrid'`: Polygon and line elements are rendered as images, so pixels are scaled during zoom\n *    animations. Point symbols and texts are accurately rendered as vectors and can stay upright on\n *    rotated views.\n *\n * @property {import(\"../source/VectorTile.js\").default} [source] Source.\n * @property {import(\"../PluggableMap.js\").default} [map] Sets the layer as overlay on a map. The map will not manage\n * this layer in its layers collection, and the layer will be rendered on top. This is useful for\n * temporary layers. The standard way to add a layer to a map and have it managed by the map is to\n * use {@link module:ol/Map#addLayer}.\n * @property {boolean} [declutter=false] Declutter images and text. Decluttering is applied to all\n * image and text styles of all Vector and VectorTile layers that have set this to `true`. The priority\n * is defined by the z-index of the layer, the `zIndex` of the style and the render order of features.\n * Higher z-index means higher priority. Within the same z-index, a feature rendered before another has\n * higher priority.\n * @property {import(\"../style/Style.js\").StyleLike} [style] Layer style. See\n * {@link module:ol/style} for default style which will be used if this is not defined.\n * @property {boolean} [updateWhileAnimating=false] When set to `true`, feature batches will be\n * recreated during animations. This means that no vectors will be shown clipped, but the setting\n * will have a performance impact for large amounts of vector data.

  * `['var', 'varName']` fetches a value from the style variables, or 0 if undefined\n *   * `['time']` returns the time in seconds since the creation of the layer\n *\n * * Math operators:\n *   * `['*', value1, value1]` multiplies `value1` by `value2`\n *   * `['/', value1, value1]` divides `value1` by `value2`\n *   * `['+', value1, value1]` adds `value1` and `value2`\n *   * `['-', value1, value1]` subtracts `value2` from `value1`\n *   * `['clamp', value, low, high]` clamps `value` between `low` and `high`\n *   * `['%', value1, value1]` returns the result of `value1 % value2` (modulo)\n *   * `['^', value1, value1]` returns the value of `value1` raised to the `value2` power\n *\n * * Transform operators:\n *   * `['case', condition1, output1, ...conditionN, outputN, fallback]` selects the first output whose corresponding\n *     condition evaluates to `true`. If no match is found, returns the `fallback` value.\n *     All conditions should be `boolean`, output and fallback can be any kind.\n *   * `['match', input, match1, output1, ...matchN, outputN, fallback]` compares the `input` value against all\n *     provided `matchX` values, returning the output associated with the first valid match.

There are two types of shaders:\n *\n *   Vertex shaders are used to manipulate the position and attribute of *vertices* of rendered primitives (ie. corners of a square).\n *   Outputs are:\n *\n *   * `gl_Position`: position of the vertex in screen space\n *\n *   * Varyings usually prefixed with `v_` are passed on to the fragment shader\n *\n *   Fragment shaders are used to control the actual color of the pixels drawn on screen. Their only output is `gl_FragColor`.\n *\n *   Both shaders can take *uniforms* or *attributes* as input. Attributes are explained later. Uniforms are common, read-only values that\n *   can be changed at every frame and can be of type float, arrays of float or images.\n *\n *   Shaders must be compiled and assembled into a program like so:\n *   ```js\n *   // here we simply create two shaders and assemble them in a program which is then used\n *   // for subsequent rendering calls\n *   const vertexShader = new WebGLVertex(VERTEX_SHADER);\n *   const fragmentShader = new WebGLFragment(FRAGMENT_SHADER);\n *   const program = this.context.getProgram(fragmentShader, vertexShader);\n *   helper.useProgram(this.program);\n *   ```\n *\n *   Uniforms are defined using the `uniforms` option and can either be explicit values or callbacks taking the frame state as argument.\n *   You can also change their value along the way like so:\n *   ```js\n *   helper.setUniformFloatValue('u_value', valueAsNumber);\n *   ```\n *\n * ### Defining post processing passes\n *\n *   *Post processing* describes the act of rendering primitives to a texture, and then rendering this texture to the final canvas\n *   while applying special effects in screen space.\n *   Typical uses are: blurring, color manipulation, depth of field, filtering...\n *\n *   The `WebGLHelper` class offers the possibility to define post processes at creation time using the `postProcesses` option.\n *   A post process step accepts the following options:\n *\n *   * `fragmentShader` and `vertexShader`: text literals in GLSL language that will be compiled and used in the post processing step.\n *   * `uniforms`: uniforms can be defined for the post processing steps just like for the main render.\n *   * `scaleRatio`: allows using an intermediate texture smaller or higher than the final canvas in the post processing step.\n *     This is typically used in blur steps to reduce the performance overhead by using an already downsampled texture as input.\n *\n *   The {@link module:ol/webgl/PostProcessingPass~WebGLPostProcessingPass} class is used internally, refer to its documentation for more info.\n *\n * ### Binding WebGL buffers and flushing data into them\n *\n *   Data that must be passed to the GPU has to be transferred using {@link module:ol/webgl/Buffer~WebGLArrayBuffer} objects.\n *   A buffer has to be created only once, but must be bound every time the buffer content will be used for rendering.\n *   This is done using {@link bindBuffer}.\n *   When the buffer's array content has changed, the new data has to be flushed to the GPU memory; this is done using\n *   {@link flushBufferData}. Note: this operation is expensive and should be done as infrequently as possible.\n *\n *   When binding an array buffer, a `target` parameter must be given: it should be either {@link module:ol/webgl.ARRAY_BUFFER}\n *   (if the buffer contains vertices data) or {@link module:ol/webgl.ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER} (if the buffer contains indices data).\n *\n *   Examples below:\n *   ```js\n *   // at initialization phase\n *   const verticesBuffer = new WebGLArrayBuffer([], DYNAMIC_DRAW);\n *   const indicesBuffer = new WebGLArrayBuffer([], DYNAMIC_DRAW);\n *\n *   // when array values have changed\n *   helper.flushBufferData(ARRAY_BUFFER, this.verticesBuffer);\n *   helper.flushBufferData(ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, this.indicesBuffer);\n *\n *   // at rendering phase\n *   helper.bindBuffer(ARRAY_BUFFER, this.verticesBuffer);\n *   helper.bindBuffer(ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, this.indicesBuffer);\n *   ```\n *\n * ### Specifying attributes\n *\n *   The GPU only receives the data as arrays of numbers. These numbers must be handled differently depending on what it describes (position, texture coordinate...).\n *   Attributes are used to specify these uses. Use {@link enableAttributeArray_} and either\n *   the default attribute names in {@link module:ol/webgl/Helper.DefaultAttrib} or custom ones.\n *\n *   Please note that you will have to specify the type and offset of the attributes in the data array. You can refer to the documentation of [WebGLRenderingContext.vertexAttribPointer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/vertexAttribPointer) for more explanation.\n *   ```js\n *   // here we indicate that the data array has the following structure:\n *   // [posX, posY, offsetX, offsetY, texCoordU, texCoordV, posX, posY, ...]\n *   helper.enableAttributes([\n *     {\n *        name: 'a_position',\n *        size: 2\n *     },\n *     {\n *       name: 'a_offset',\n *       size: 2\n *     },\n *     {\n *       name: 'a_texCoord',\n *       size: 2\n *     }\n *   ])\n *   ```\n *\n * ### Rendering primitives\n *\n *   Once all the steps above have been achieved, rendering primitives to the screen is done using {@link prepareDraw}, {@link drawElements} and {@link finalizeDraw}.\n *   ```js\n *   // frame preparation step\n *   helper.prepareDraw(frameState);\n *\n *   // call this for every data array that has to be rendered on screen\n *   helper.drawElements(0, this.indicesBuffer.getArray().length);\n *\n *   // finalize the rendering by applying post processes\n *   helper.finalizeDraw(frameState);\n *   ```\n *\n * For an example usage of this class, refer to {@link module:ol/renderer/webgl/PointsLayer~WebGLPointsLayerRenderer}.\n *\n *\n * @api\n */\nclass WebGLHelper extends Disposable {\n  /**\n   * @param {Options=} opt_options Options.\n   */\n  constructor(opt_options) {\n    super();\n    const options = opt_options || {};\n\n    /** @private */\n    this.boundHandleWebGLContextLost_ = this.handleWebGLContextLost.bind(this);\n\n    /** @private */\n    this.boundHandleWebGLContextRestored_ = this.handleWebGLContextRestored.bind(this);\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {HTMLCanvasElement}\n     */\n    this.canvas_ = document.createElement('canvas');\n    this.canvas_.style.position = 'absolute';\n    this.canvas_.style.left = '0';\n\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {WebGLRenderingContext}\n     */\n    this.gl_ = getContext(this.canvas_);\n    const gl = this.getGL();\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {!Object<string, BufferCacheEntry>}\n     */\n    this.bufferCache_ = {};\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {!Array<WebGLShader>}\n     */\n    this.shaderCache_ = [];\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {!Array<WebGLProgram>}\n     */\n    this.programCache_ = [];\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {WebGLProgram}\n     */\n    this.currentProgram_ = null;\n\n    assert(includes(getSupportedExtensions(), 'OES_element_index_uint'), 63);\n    gl.getExtension('OES_element_index_uint');\n\n    this.canvas_.addEventListener(ContextEventType.LOST, this.boundHandleWebGLContextLost_);\n    this.canvas_.addEventListener(ContextEventType.RESTORED, this.boundHandleWebGLContextRestored_);\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {import(\"../transform.js\").Transform}\n     */\n    this.offsetRotateMatrix_ = createTransform();\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {import(\"../transform.js\").Transform}\n     */\n    this.offsetScaleMatrix_ = createTransform();\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {Array<number>}\n     */\n    this.tmpMat4_ = create();\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {Object.<string, WebGLUniformLocation>}\n     */\n    this.uniformLocations_ = {};\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {Object.<string, number>}\n     */\n    this.attribLocations_ = {};\n\n    /**\n     * Holds info about custom uniforms used in the post processing pass.\n     * If the uniform is a texture, the WebGL Texture object will be stored here.\n     * @type {Array<UniformInternalDescription>}\n     * @private\n     */\n    this.uniforms_ = [];\n    if (options.uniforms) {\n      for (const name in options.uniforms) {\n        this.uniforms_.push({\n          name: name,\n          value: options.uniforms[name]\n        });\n      }\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * An array of PostProcessingPass objects is kept in this variable, built from the steps provided in the\n     * options.
