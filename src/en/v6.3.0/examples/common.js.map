The projection determines the\n * coordinate system of the center, and its units determine the units of the\n * resolution (projection units per pixel). The default projection is\n * Spherical Mercator (EPSG:3857).\n *\n * ### The view states\n *\n * A View is determined by three states: `center`, `resolution`,\n * and `rotation`. Each state has a corresponding getter and setter, e.g.\n * `getCenter` and `setCenter` for the `center` state.\n *\n * The `zoom` state is actually not saved on the view: all computations\n * internally use the `resolution` state. Still, the `setZoom` and `getZoom`\n * methods are available, as well as `getResolutionForZoom` and\n * `getZoomForResolution` to switch from one system to the other.\n *\n * ### The constraints\n *\n * `setCenter`, `setResolution` and `setRotation` can be used to change the\n * states of the view, but any constraint defined in the constructor will\n * be applied along the way.\n *\n * A View object can have a *resolution constraint*, a *rotation constraint*\n * and a *center constraint*.\n *\n * The *resolution constraint* typically restricts min/max values and\n * snaps to specific resolutions. It is determined by the following\n * options: `resolutions`, `maxResolution`, `maxZoom` and `zoomFactor`.\n * If `resolutions` is set, the other three options are ignored. See\n * documentation for each option for more information. By default, the view\n * only has a min/max restriction and allow intermediary zoom levels when\n * pinch-zooming for example.\n *\n * The *rotation constraint* snaps to specific angles. It is determined\n * by the following options: `enableRotation` and `constrainRotation`.\n * By default rotation is allowed and its value is snapped to zero when approaching the\n * horizontal.\n *\n * The *center constraint* is determined by the `extent` option. By\n * default the view center is not constrained at all.\n *\n * ### Changing the view state\n *\n * It is important to note that `setZoom`, `setResolution`, `setCenter` and\n * `setRotation` are subject to the above mentioned constraints. As such, it\n * may sometimes not be possible to know in advance the resulting state of the\n * View. For example, calling `setResolution(10)` does not guarantee that\n * `getResolution()` will return `10`.\n *\n * A consequence of this is that, when applying a delta on the view state, one\n * should use `adjustCenter`, `adjustRotation`, `adjustZoom` and `adjustResolution`\n * rather than the corresponding setters.

Just make sure to call `register(proj4)` again; for example, with user-supplied data where you don't\n * know in advance what projections are needed, you can initially load minimal\n * support and then load whichever are requested.\n *\n * Note that Proj4js does not support projection extents. If you want to add\n * one for creating default tile grids, you can add it after the Projection\n * object has been created with `setExtent`, for example,\n * `get('EPSG:1234').setExtent(extent)`.\n *\n * In addition to Proj4js support, any transform functions can be added with\n * {@link module:ol/proj~addCoordinateTransforms}. To use this, you must first create\n * a {@link module:ol/proj/Projection} object for the new projection and add it with\n * {@link module:ol/proj~addProjection}. You can then add the forward and inverse\n * functions with {@link module:ol/proj~addCoordinateTransforms}. See\n * examples/wms-custom-proj for an example of this.\n *\n * Note that if no transforms are needed and you only need to define the\n * projection, just add a {@link module:ol/proj/Projection} with\n * {@link module:ol/proj~addProjection}.

The pre-defined properties are listed in this documentation as\n * 'Observable Properties', and have their own accessors; for example,\n * {@link module:ol/Map~Map} has a `target` property, accessed with\n * `getTarget()` and changed with `setTarget()`. Not all properties are however\n * settable. There are also general-purpose accessors `get()` and `set()`. For\n * example, `get('target')` is equivalent to `getTarget()`.\n *\n * The `set` accessors trigger a change event, and you can monitor this by\n * registering a listener. For example, {@link module:ol/View~View} has a\n * `center` property, so `view.on('change:center', function(evt) {...});` would\n * call the function whenever the value of the center property changes. Within\n * the function, `evt.target` would be the view, so `evt.target.getCenter()`\n * would return the new center.\n *\n * You can add your own observable properties with\n * `object.set('prop', 'value')`, and retrieve that with `object.get('prop')`.\n * You can listen for changes on that property value with\n * `object.on('change:prop', listener)`. You can get a list of all\n * properties with {@link module:ol/Object~BaseObject#getProperties}.\n *\n * Note that the observable properties are separate from standard JS properties.\n * You can, for example, give your map object a title with\n * `map.title='New title'` and with `map.set('title', 'Another title')`. The\n * first will be a `hasOwnProperty`; the second will appear in\n * `getProperties()`. Only the second is observable.\n *\n * Properties can be deleted by using the unset method.

Point symbols and texts are accurately rendered as vectors and can stay upright on\n *    rotated views.\n *  * `'vector'`: Everything is rendered as vectors.

See\n * {@link module:ol/style} for default style which will be used if this is not defined.\n * @property {boolean} [updateWhileAnimating=false] When set to `true`, feature batches will be\n * recreated during animations. This means that no vectors will be shown clipped, but the setting\n * will have a performance impact for large amounts of vector data. When set to `false`, batches\n * will be recreated when no animation is active.\n * @property {boolean} [updateWhileInteracting=false] When set to `true`, feature batches will be\n * recreated during interactions.

style parameters; can be a number literal or the output of an operator,\n * which in turns takes {@link ExpressionValue} arguments.\n *\n * The following operators can be used:\n *\n * * Reading operators:\n *   * `['get', 'attributeName']` fetches a feature attribute (it will be prefixed by `a_` in the shader)\n *     Note: those will be taken from the attributes provided to the renderer\n *   * `['var', 'varName']` fetches a value from the style variables, or 0 if undefined\n *   * `['time']` returns the time in seconds since the creation of the layer\n *   * `['zoom']` returns the current zoom level\n *   * `['resolution']` returns the current resolution\n *\n * * Math operators:\n *   * `['*', value1, value2]` multiplies `value1` by `value2`\n *   * `['/', value1, value2]` divides `value1` by `value2`\n *   * `['+', value1, value2]` adds `value1` and `value2`\n *   * `['-', value1, value2]` subtracts `value2` from `value1`\n *   * `['clamp', value, low, high]` clamps `value` between `low` and `high`\n *   * `['%', value1, value2]` returns the result of `value1 % value2` (modulo)\n *   * `['^', value1, value2]` returns the value of `value1` raised to the `value2` power\n *\n * * Transform operators:\n *   * `['case', condition1, output1, ...conditionN, outputN, fallback]` selects the first output whose corresponding\n *     condition evaluates to `true`. If no match is found, returns the `fallback` value.\n *     All conditions should be `boolean`, output and fallback can be any kind.\n *   * `['match', input, match1, output1, ...matchN, outputN, fallback]` compares the `input` value against all\n *     provided `matchX` values, returning the output associated with the first valid match. If no match is found,\n *     returns the `fallback` value.\n *     `input` and `matchX` values must all be of the same type, and can be `number` or `string`. `outputX` and\n *     `fallback` values must be of the same type, and can be of any kind.\n *   * `['interpolate', interpolation, input, stop1, output1, ...stopN, outputN]` returns a value by interpolating between\n *     pairs of inputs and outputs; `interpolation` can either be `['linear']` or `['exponential', base]` where `base` is\n *     the rate of increase from stop A to stop B (i.e. power to which the interpolation ratio is raised); a value\n *     of 1 is equivalent to `['linear']`.\n *     `input` and `stopX` values must all be of type `number`. `outputX` values can be `number` or `color` values.\n *     Note: `input` will be clamped between `stop1` and `stopN`, meaning that all output values will be comprised\n *     between `output1` and `outputN`.\n *\n * * Logical operators:\n *   * `['<', value1, value2]` returns `true` if `value1` is strictly lower than `value2`, or `false` otherwise.\n *   * `['<=', value1, value2]` returns `true` if `value1` is lower than or equals `value2`, or `false` otherwise.\n *   * `['>', value1, value2]` returns `true` if `value1` is strictly greater than `value2`, or `false` otherwise.\n *   * `['>=', value1, value2]` returns `true` if `value1` is greater than or equals `value2`, or `false` otherwise.\n *   * `['==', value1, value2]` returns `true` if `value1` equals `value2`, or `false` otherwise.\n *   * `['!=', value1, value2]` returns `true` if `value1` does not equal `value2`, or `false` otherwise.\n *   * `['!', value1]` returns `false` if `value1` is `true` or greater than `0`, or `true` otherwise.\n *   * `['between', value1, value2, value3]` returns `true` if `value1` is contained between `value2` and `value3`\n *     (inclusively), or `false` otherwise.\n *\n * * Conversion operators:\n *   * `['array', value1, ...valueN]` creates a numerical array from `number` values; please note that the amount of\n *     values can currently only be 2, 3 or 4.\n *   * `['color', red, green, blue, alpha]` creates a `color` value from `number` values; the `alpha` parameter is\n *     optional; if not specified, it will be set to 1.\n *     Note: `red`, `green` and `blue` components must be values between 0 and 255; `alpha` between 0 and 1.\n *\n * Values can either be literals or another operator, as they will be evaluated recursively.\n * Literal values can be of the following types:\n * * `boolean`\n * * `number`\n * * `string`\n * * {@link module:ol/color~Color}\n *\n * @typedef {Array<*>|import(\"../color.js\").Color|string|number|boolean} ExpressionValue\n */\n\n/**\n * Possible inferred types from a given value or expression.\n * Note: these are binary flags.\n * @enum {number}\n */\nexport const ValueTypes = {\n  NUMBER: 0b00001,\n  STRING: 0b00010,\n  COLOR: 0b00100,\n  BOOLEAN: 0b01000,\n  NUMBER_ARRAY: 0b10000,\n  ANY: 0b11111,\n  NONE: 0\n};\n\n/**\n * An operator declaration must contain two methods: `getReturnType` which returns a type based on\n * the operator arguments, and `toGlsl` which returns a GLSL-compatible string.\n * Note: both methods can process arguments recursively.\n * @typedef {Object} Operator\n * @property {function(Array<ExpressionValue>): ValueTypes|number} getReturnType Returns one or several types\n * @property {function(ParsingContext, Array<ExpressionValue>, ValueTypes=): string} toGlsl Returns a GLSL-compatible string\n * Note: takes in an optional type hint as 3rd parameter\n */\n\n/**\n * Operator declarations\n * @type {Object<string, Operator>}\n */\nexport const Operators = {};\n\n/**\n * Returns the possible types for a given value (each type being a binary flag)\n * To test a value use e.g. `getValueType(v) & ValueTypes.BOOLEAN`\n * @param {ExpressionValue} value Value\n * @returns {ValueTypes|number} Type or types inferred from the value\n */\nexport function getValueType(value) {\n  if (typeof value === 'number') {\n    return ValueTypes.NUMBER;\n  }\n  if (typeof value === 'boolean') {\n    return ValueTypes.BOOLEAN;\n  }\n  if (typeof value === 'string') {\n    if (isStringColor(value)) {\n      return ValueTypes.COLOR | ValueTypes.STRING;\n    }\n    return ValueTypes.STRING;\n  }\n  if (!Array.isArray(value)) {\n    throw new Error(`Unhandled value type: ${JSON.stringify(value)}`);\n  }\n  const valueArr = /** @type {Array<*>} */(value);\n  const onlyNumbers = valueArr.every(function(v) {\n    return typeof v === 'number';\n  });\n  if (onlyNumbers) {\n    if (valueArr.length === 3 || valueArr.length === 4) {\n      return ValueTypes.COLOR | ValueTypes.NUMBER_ARRAY;\n    }\n    return ValueTypes.NUMBER_ARRAY;\n  }\n  if (typeof valueArr[0] !== 'string') {\n    throw new Error(`Expected an expression operator but received: ${JSON.stringify(valueArr)}`);\n  }\n  const operator = Operators[valueArr[0]];\n  if (operator === undefined) {\n    throw new Error(`Unrecognized expression operator: ${JSON.stringify(valueArr)}`);\n  }\n  return operator.getReturnType(valueArr.slice(1));\n}\n\n/**\n * Checks if only one value type is enabled in the input number.\n * @param {ValueTypes|number} valueType Number containing value type binary flags\n * @return {boolean} True if only one type flag is enabled, false if zero or multiple\n */\nexport function isTypeUnique(valueType) {\n  return Math.log2(valueType) % 1 === 0;\n}\n\n/**\n * Context available during the parsing of an expression.\n * @typedef {Object} ParsingContext\n * @property {boolean} [inFragmentShader] If false, means the expression output should be made for a vertex shader\n * @property {Array<string>} variables List of variables used in the expression;

There are two types of shaders:\n *\n *   Vertex shaders are used to manipulate the position and attribute of *vertices* of rendered primitives (ie. corners of a square).\n *   Outputs are:\n *\n *   * `gl_Position`: position of the vertex in screen space\n *\n *   * Varyings usually prefixed with `v_` are passed on to the fragment shader\n *\n *   Fragment shaders are used to control the actual color of the pixels drawn on screen. Their only output is `gl_FragColor`.\n *\n *   Both shaders can take *uniforms* or *attributes* as input. Attributes are explained later. Uniforms are common, read-only values that\n *   can be changed at every frame and can be of type float, arrays of float or images.\n *\n *   Shaders must be compiled and assembled into a program like so:\n *   ```js\n *   // here we simply create two shaders and assemble them in a program which is then used\n *   // for subsequent rendering calls\n *   const vertexShader = new WebGLVertex(VERTEX_SHADER);\n *   const fragmentShader = new WebGLFragment(FRAGMENT_SHADER);\n *   const program = this.context.getProgram(fragmentShader, vertexShader);\n *   helper.useProgram(this.program);\n *   ```\n *\n *   Uniforms are defined using the `uniforms` option and can either be explicit values or callbacks taking the frame state as argument.\n *   You can also change their value along the way like so:\n *   ```js\n *   helper.setUniformFloatValue('u_value', valueAsNumber);\n *   ```\n *\n * ### Defining post processing passes\n *\n *   *Post processing* describes the act of rendering primitives to a texture, and then rendering this texture to the final canvas\n *   while applying special effects in screen space.\n *   Typical uses are: blurring, color manipulation, depth of field, filtering...\n *\n *   The `WebGLHelper` class offers the possibility to define post processes at creation time using the `postProcesses` option.\n *   A post process step accepts the following options:\n *\n *   * `fragmentShader` and `vertexShader`: text literals in GLSL language that will be compiled and used in the post processing step.\n *   * `uniforms`: uniforms can be defined for the post processing steps just like for the main render.\n *   * `scaleRatio`: allows using an intermediate texture smaller or higher than the final canvas in the post processing step.\n *     This is typically used in blur steps to reduce the performance overhead by using an already downsampled texture as input.\n *\n *   The {@link module:ol/webgl/PostProcessingPass~WebGLPostProcessingPass} class is used internally, refer to its documentation for more info.\n *\n * ### Binding WebGL buffers and flushing data into them\n *\n *   Data that must be passed to the GPU has to be transferred using {@link module:ol/webgl/Buffer~WebGLArrayBuffer} objects.\n *   A buffer has to be created only once, but must be bound every time the buffer content will be used for rendering.\n *   This is done using {@link bindBuffer}.\n *   When the buffer's array content has changed, the new data has to be flushed to the GPU memory; this is done using\n *   {@link flushBufferData}. Note: this operation is expensive and should be done as infrequently as possible.\n *\n *   When binding an array buffer, a `target` parameter must be given: it should be either {@link module:ol/webgl.ARRAY_BUFFER}\n *   (if the buffer contains vertices data) or {@link module:ol/webgl.ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER} (if the buffer contains indices data).\n *\n *   Examples below:\n *   ```js\n *   // at initialization phase\n *   const verticesBuffer = new WebGLArrayBuffer([], DYNAMIC_DRAW);\n *   const indicesBuffer = new WebGLArrayBuffer([], DYNAMIC_DRAW);\n *\n *   // when array values have changed\n *   helper.flushBufferData(ARRAY_BUFFER, this.verticesBuffer);\n *   helper.flushBufferData(ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, this.indicesBuffer);\n *\n *   // at rendering phase\n *   helper.bindBuffer(ARRAY_BUFFER, this.verticesBuffer);\n *   helper.bindBuffer(ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, this.indicesBuffer);\n *   ```\n *\n * ### Specifying attributes\n *\n *   The GPU only receives the data as arrays of numbers. These numbers must be handled differently depending on what it describes (position, texture coordinate...).\n *   Attributes are used to specify these uses.

[opacity=1] Opacity (0, 1).\n * @property {boolean} [visible=true] Visibility.\n * @property {import(\"../extent.js\").Extent} [extent] The bounding extent for layer rendering.  The layer will not be\n * rendered outside of this extent.\n * @property {number} [zIndex] The z-index for layer rendering.  At rendering time, the layers\n * will be ordered, first by Z-index and then by position. When `undefined`, a `zIndex` of 0 is assumed\n * for layers that are added to the map's `layers` collection, or `Infinity` when the layer's `setMap()`\n * method was used.\n * @property {number} [minResolution] The minimum resolution (inclusive) at which this layer will be\n * visible.\n * @property {number} [maxResolution] The maximum resolution (exclusive) below which this layer will\n * be visible.\n * @property {number} [minZoom] The minimum view zoom level (exclusive) above which this layer will be\n * visible.\n * @property {number} [maxZoom] The maximum view zoom level (inclusive) at which this layer will\n * be visible.\n * @property {import(\"../render.js\").OrderFunction} [renderOrder] Render order. Function to be used when sorting\n * features before rendering. By default features are drawn in the order that they are created. Use\n * `null` to avoid the sort, but get an undefined draw order.\n * @property {number} [renderBuffer=100] The buffer in pixels around the viewport extent used by the\n * renderer when getting features from the vector source for the rendering or hit-detection.\n * Recommended value: the size of the largest symbol, line width or label.\n * @property {import(\"../source/Vector.js\").default} [source] Source.\n * @property {import(\"../PluggableMap.js\").default} [map] Sets the layer as overlay on a map. The map will not manage\n * this layer in its layers collection, and the layer will be rendered on top. This is useful for\n * temporary layers. The standard way to add a layer to a map and have it managed by the map is to\n * use {@link module:ol/Map#addLayer}.\n * @property {boolean} [declutter=false] Declutter images and text on this layer. The priority is defined\n * by the `zIndex` of the style and the render order of features. Higher z-index means higher priority.\n * Within the same z-index, a feature rendered before another has higher priority.\n * @property {import(\"../style/Style.js\").StyleLike} [style] Layer style. See\n * {@link module:ol/style} for default style which will be used if this is not defined.\n * @property {boolean} [updateWhileAnimating=false] When set to `true`, feature batches will\n * be recreated during animations. This means that no vectors will be shown clipped, but the\n * setting will have a performance impact for large amounts of vector data. When set to `false`,\n * batches will be recreated when no animation is active.\n * @property {boolean} [updateWhileInteracting=false] When set to `true`, feature batches will\n * be recreated during interactions. See also `updateWhileAnimating`.\n * @property {number} [imageRatio=1] Ratio by which the rendered extent should be larger than the\n * viewport extent. A larger ratio avoids cut images during panning, but will cause a decrease in performance.\n */\n\n\n/**\n * @classdesc\n * Vector data that is rendered client-side.\n * Note that any property set in the options is set as a {@link module:ol/Object~BaseObject}\n * property on the layer object; for example, setting `title: 'My Title'` in the\n * options means that `title` is observable, and has get/set accessors.\n *\n * @api\n */\nclass VectorImageLayer extends BaseVectorLayer {\n  /**\n   * @param {Options=} opt_options Options.\n   */\n  constructor(opt_options) {\n    const options = opt_options ? opt_options : {};\n\n    const baseOptions = assign({}, options);\n    delete baseOptions.imageRatio;\n    super(baseOptions);\n\n    /**\n     * @type {number}\n     * @private\n     */\n    this.imageRatio_ = options.imageRatio !== undefined ? options.imageRatio : 1;\n\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @return {number} Ratio between rendered extent size and viewport extent size.\n   */\n  getImageRatio() {\n    return this.imageRatio_;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Create a renderer for this layer.\n   * @return {import(\"../renderer/Layer.js\").default} A layer renderer.\n   * @protected\n   */\n  createRenderer() {\n    return new CanvasVectorImageLayerRenderer(this);\n  }\n}\n\n\nexport default VectorImageLayer;\n","var g;\n\n// This works in non-strict mode\ng = (function() {\n\treturn this;\n})();\n\ntry {\n\t// This works if eval is allowed (see CSP)\n\tg = g || new Function(\"return this\")();\n} catch (e) {\n\t// This works if the window reference is available\n\tif (typeof window === \"object\") g = window;\n}\n\n// g can still be undefined, but nothing to do about it...\n// We return undefined, instead of nothing here, so it's\n// easier to handle this case. if(!global) { ...}\n\nmodule.exports = g;\n","exports.read = function (buffer, offset, isLE, mLen, nBytes) {\n  var e, m\n  var eLen = (nBytes * 8) - mLen - 1\n  var eMax = (1 << eLen) - 1\n  var eBias = eMax >> 1\n  var nBits = -7\n  var i = isLE ?
