The projection determines the\n * coordinate system of the center, and its units determine the units of the\n * resolution (projection units per pixel). The default projection is\n * Spherical Mercator (EPSG:3857).\n *\n * ### The view states\n *\n * A View is determined by three states: `center`, `resolution`,\n * and `rotation`. Each state has a corresponding getter and setter, e.g.\n * `getCenter` and `setCenter` for the `center` state.\n *\n * The `zoom` state is actually not saved on the view: all computations\n * internally use the `resolution` state. Still, the `setZoom` and `getZoom`\n * methods are available, as well as `getResolutionForZoom` and\n * `getZoomForResolution` to switch from one system to the other.\n *\n * ### The constraints\n *\n * `setCenter`, `setResolution` and `setRotation` can be used to change the\n * states of the view, but any constraint defined in the constructor will\n * be applied along the way.\n *\n * A View object can have a *resolution constraint*, a *rotation constraint*\n * and a *center constraint*.\n *\n * The *resolution constraint* typically restricts min/max values and\n * snaps to specific resolutions. It is determined by the following\n * options: `resolutions`, `maxResolution`, `maxZoom` and `zoomFactor`.\n * If `resolutions` is set, the other three options are ignored. See\n * documentation for each option for more information. By default, the view\n * only has a min/max restriction and allow intermediary zoom levels when\n * pinch-zooming for example.\n *\n * The *rotation constraint* snaps to specific angles. It is determined\n * by the following options: `enableRotation` and `constrainRotation`.\n * By default rotation is allowed and its value is snapped to zero when approaching the\n * horizontal.\n *\n * The *center constraint* is determined by the `extent` option. By\n * default the view center is not constrained at all.\n *\n * ### Changing the view state\n *\n * It is important to note that `setZoom`, `setResolution`, `setCenter` and\n * `setRotation` are subject to the above mentioned constraints. As such, it\n * may sometimes not be possible to know in advance the resulting state of the\n * View. For example, calling `setResolution(10)` does not guarantee that\n * `getResolution()` will return `10`.\n *\n * A consequence of this is that, when applying a delta on the view state, one\n * should use `adjustCenter`, `adjustRotation`, `adjustZoom` and `adjustResolution`\n * rather than the corresponding setters. This will let view do its internal\n * computations. Besides, the `adjust*` methods also take an `opt_anchor`\n * argument which allows specifying an origin for the transformation.\n *\n * ### Interacting with the view\n *\n * View constraints are usually only applied when the view is *at rest*, meaning that\n * no interaction or animation is ongoing. As such, if the user puts the view in a\n * state that is not equivalent to a constrained one (e.g. rotating the view when\n * the snap angle is 0), an animation will be triggered at the interaction end to\n * put back the view to a stable state;\n *\n * @api\n */\nclass View extends BaseObject {\n\n  /**\n   * @param {ViewOptions=} opt_options View options.\n   */\n  constructor(opt_options) {\n    super();\n\n    const options = assign({}, opt_options);\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {Array<number>}\n     */\n    this.hints_ = [0, 0];\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {Array<Array<Animation>>}\n     */\n    this.animations_ = [];\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {number|undefined}\n     */\n    this.updateAnimationKey_;\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @const\n     * @type {import(\"./proj/Projection.js\").default}\n     */\n    this.projection_ = createProjection(options.projection, 'EPSG:3857');\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {import(\"./size.js\").Size}\n     */\n    this.viewportSize_ = [100, 100];\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {import(\"./coordinate.js\").Coordinate|undefined}\n     */\n    this.targetCenter_ = null;\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {number|undefined}\n     */\n    this.targetResolution_;\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {number|undefined}\n     */\n    this.targetRotation_;\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {import(\"./coordinate.js\").Coordinate|undefined}\n     */\n    this.cancelAnchor_ = undefined;\n\n    if (options.center) {\n      options.center = fromUserCoordinate(options.center, this.projection_);\n    }\n    if (options.extent) {\n      options.extent = fromUserExtent(options.extent, this.projection_);\n    }\n\n    this.applyOptions_(options);\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Set up the view with the given options.\n   * @param {ViewOptions} options View options.\n   */\n  applyOptions_(options) {\n\n    /**\n     * @type {Object<string, *>}\n     */\n    const properties = {};\n\n    const resolutionConstraintInfo = createResolutionConstraint(options);\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {number}\n     */\n    this.maxResolution_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.maxResolution;\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {number}\n     */\n    this.minResolution_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.minResolution;\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {number}\n     */\n    this.zoomFactor_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.zoomFactor;\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {Array<number>|undefined}\n     */\n    this.resolutions_ = options.resolutions;\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {number}\n     */\n    this.minZoom_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.minZoom;\n\n    const centerConstraint = createCenterConstraint(options);\n    const resolutionConstraint = resolutionConstraintInfo.constraint;\n    const rotationConstraint = createRotationConstraint(options);\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {Constraints}\n     */\n    this.constraints_ = {\n      center: centerConstraint,\n      resolution: resolutionConstraint,\n      rotation: rotationConstraint\n    };\n\n    this.setRotation(options.rotation !== undefined ? options.rotation : 0);\n    this.setCenterInternal(options.center !== undefined ? options.center : null);\n    if (options.resolution !== undefined) {\n      this.setResolution(options.resolution);\n    } else if (options.zoom !== undefined) {\n      this.setZoom(options.zoom);\n    }\n    this.resolveConstraints(0);\n\n    this.setProperties(properties);\n\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {ViewOptions}\n     */\n    this.options_ = options;\n\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Get an updated version of the view options used to construct the view.

Default is the view projection.\n * @property {number} [reprojectionErrorThreshold=0.5] Maximum allowed reprojection error (in pixels).\n * Higher values can increase reprojection performance, but decrease precision.\n * @property {import(\"./State.js\").default} [state] Source state.\n * @property {typeof import(\"../ImageTile.js\").default} [tileClass] Class used to instantiate image tiles.\n * Default is {@link module:ol/ImageTile~ImageTile}.\n * @property {import(\"../tilegrid/TileGrid.js\").default} [tileGrid] Tile grid.\n * @property {import(\"../Tile.js\").LoadFunction} [tileLoadFunction] Optional function to load a tile given a URL. The default is\n * ```js\n * function(imageTile, src) {\n *   imageTile.getImage().src = src;\n * };\n * ```\n * @property {number} [tilePixelRatio=1] The pixel ratio used by the tile service. For example, if the tile\n * service advertizes 256px by 256px tiles but actually sends 512px\n * by 512px images (for retina/hidpi devices) then `tilePixelRatio`\n * should be set to `2`.\n * @property {import(\"../Tile.js\").UrlFunction} [tileUrlFunction] Optional function to get tile URL given a tile coordinate and the projection.\n * @property {string} [url] URL template. Must include `{x}`, `{y}` or `{-y}`, and `{z}` placeholders.\n * A `{?-?}` template pattern, for example `subdomain{a-f}.domain.com`, may be\n * used instead of defining each one separately in the `urls` option.\n * @property {Array<string>} [urls] An array of URL templates.\n * @property {boolean} [wrapX] Whether to wrap the world horizontally. The default, is to\n * request out-of-bounds tiles from the server. When set to `false`, only one\n * world will be rendered. When set to `true`, tiles will be requested for one\n * world only, but they will be wrapped horizontally to render multiple worlds.\n * @property {number} [transition] Duration of the opacity transition for rendering.\n * To disable the opacity transition, pass `transition: 0`.\n * @property {string} [key] Optional tile key for proper cache fetching\n * @property {number} [zDirection=0] Indicate which resolution should be used\n * by a renderer if the view resolution does not match any resolution of the tile source.\n * If 0, the nearest resolution will be used. If 1, the nearest lower resolution\n * will be used. If -1, the nearest higher resolution will be used.\n */\n\n\n/**\n * @classdesc\n * Base class for sources providing images divided into a tile grid.\n *\n * @fires import(\"./Tile.js\").TileSourceEvent\n * @api\n */\nclass TileImage extends UrlTile {\n  /**\n   * @param {!Options} options Image tile options.\n   */\n  constructor(options) {\n\n    super({\n      attributions: options.attributions,\n      cacheSize: options.cacheSize,\n      opaque: options.opaque,\n      projection: options.projection,\n      state: options.state,\n      tileGrid: options.tileGrid,\n      tileLoadFunction: options.tileLoadFunction ?\n        options.tileLoadFunction : defaultTileLoadFunction,\n      tilePixelRatio: options.tilePixelRatio,\n      tileUrlFunction: options.tileUrlFunction,\n      url: options.url,\n      urls: options.urls,\n      wrapX: options.wrapX,\n      transition: options.transition,\n      key: options.key,\n      attributionsCollapsible: options.attributionsCollapsible,\n      zDirection: options.zDirection\n    });\n\n    /**\n     * @protected\n     * @type {?string}\n     */\n    this.crossOrigin =\n        options.crossOrigin !== undefined ?

At rendering time, the layers\n * will be ordered, first by Z-index and then by position.

style parameters; can be a number literal or the output of an operator,\n * which in turns takes {@link ExpressionValue} arguments.\n *\n * The following operators can be used:\n *\n * * Reading operators:\n *   * `['get', 'attributeName']` fetches a feature attribute (it will be prefixed by `a_` in the shader)\n *     Note: those will be taken from the attributes provided to the renderer\n *   * `['var', 'varName']` fetches a value from the style variables, or 0 if undefined\n *   * `['time']` returns the time in seconds since the creation of the layer\n *   * `['zoom']` returns the current zoom level\n *   * `['resolution']` returns the current resolution\n *\n * * Math operators:\n *   * `['*', value1, value2]` multiplies `value1` by `value2`\n *   * `['/', value1, value2]` divides `value1` by `value2`\n *   * `['+', value1, value2]` adds `value1` and `value2`\n *   * `['-', value1, value2]` subtracts `value2` from `value1`\n *   * `['clamp', value, low, high]` clamps `value` between `low` and `high`\n *   * `['%', value1, value2]` returns the result of `value1 % value2` (modulo)\n *   * `['^', value1, value2]` returns the value of `value1` raised to the `value2` power\n *\n * * Transform operators:\n *   * `['case', condition1, output1, ...conditionN, outputN, fallback]` selects the first output whose corresponding\n *     condition evaluates to `true`. If no match is found, returns the `fallback` value.\n *     All conditions should be `boolean`, output and fallback can be any kind.\n *   * `['match', input, match1, output1, ...matchN, outputN, fallback]` compares the `input` value against all\n *     provided `matchX` values, returning the output associated with the first valid match. If no match is found,\n *     returns the `fallback` value.\n *     `input` and `matchX` values must all be of the same type, and can be `number` or `string`. `outputX` and\n *     `fallback` values must be of the same type, and can be of any kind.\n *   * `['interpolate', interpolation, input, stop1, output1, ...stopN, outputN]` returns a value by interpolating between\n *     pairs of inputs and outputs; `interpolation` can either be `['linear']` or `['exponential', base]` where `base` is\n *     the rate of increase from stop A to stop B (i.e. power to which the interpolation ratio is raised); a value\n *     of 1 is equivalent to `['linear']`.\n *     `input` and `stopX` values must all be of type `number`. `outputX` values can be `number` or `color` values.\n *     Note: `input` will be clamped between `stop1` and `stopN`, meaning that all output values will be comprised\n *     between `output1` and `outputN`.\n *\n * * Logical operators:\n *   * `['<', value1, value2]` returns `true` if `value1` is strictly lower than `value2`, or `false` otherwise.\n *   * `['<=', value1, value2]` returns `true` if `value1` is lower than or equals `value2`, or `false` otherwise.\n *   * `['>', value1, value2]` returns `true` if `value1` is strictly greater than `value2`, or `false` otherwise.\n *   * `['>=', value1, value2]` returns `true` if `value1` is greater than or equals `value2`, or `false` otherwise.\n *   * `['==', value1, value2]` returns `true` if `value1` equals `value2`, or `false` otherwise.\n *   * `['!=', value1, value2]` returns `true` if `value1` does not equal `value2`, or `false` otherwise.\n *   * `['!', value1]` returns `false` if `value1` is `true` or greater than `0`, or `true` otherwise.\n *   * `['between', value1, value2, value3]` returns `true` if `value1` is contained between `value2` and `value3`\n *     (inclusively), or `false` otherwise.\n *\n * * Conversion operators:\n *   * `['array', value1, ...valueN]` creates a numerical array from `number` values; please note that the amount of\n *     values can currently only be 2, 3 or 4.\n *   * `['color', red, green, blue, alpha]` creates a `color` value from `number` values; the `alpha` parameter is\n *     optional; if not specified, it will be set to 1.\n *     Note: `red`, `green` and `blue` components must be values between 0 and 255; `alpha` between 0 and 1.\n *\n * Values can either be literals or another operator, as they will be evaluated recursively.\n * Literal values can be of the following types:\n * * `boolean`\n * * `number`\n * * `string`\n * * {@link module:ol/color~Color}\n *\n * @typedef {Array<*>|import(\"../color.js\").Color|string|number|boolean} ExpressionValue\n */\n\n/**\n * Possible inferred types from a given value or expression.\n * Note: these are binary flags.\n * @enum {number}\n */\nexport const ValueTypes = {\n  NUMBER: 0b00001,\n  STRING: 0b00010,\n  COLOR: 0b00100,\n  BOOLEAN: 0b01000,\n  NUMBER_ARRAY: 0b10000,\n  ANY: 0b11111,\n  NONE: 0\n};\n\n/**\n * An operator declaration must contain two methods: `getReturnType` which returns a type based on\n * the operator arguments, and `toGlsl` which returns a GLSL-compatible string.\n * Note: both methods can process arguments recursively.\n * @typedef {Object} Operator\n * @property {function(Array<ExpressionValue>): ValueTypes|number} getReturnType Returns one or several types\n * @property {function(ParsingContext, Array<ExpressionValue>, ValueTypes=): string} toGlsl Returns a GLSL-compatible string\n * Note: takes in an optional type hint as 3rd parameter\n */\n\n/**\n * Operator declarations\n * @type {Object<string, Operator>}\n */\nexport const Operators = {};\n\n/**\n * Returns the possible types for a given value (each type being a binary flag)\n * To test a value use e.g. `getValueType(v) & ValueTypes.BOOLEAN`\n * @param {ExpressionValue} value Value\n * @returns {ValueTypes|number} Type or types inferred from the value\n */\nexport function getValueType(value) {\n  if (typeof value === 'number') {\n    return ValueTypes.NUMBER;\n  }\n  if (typeof value === 'boolean') {\n    return ValueTypes.BOOLEAN;\n  }\n  if (typeof value === 'string') {\n    if (isStringColor(value)) {\n      return ValueTypes.COLOR | ValueTypes.STRING;\n    }\n    return ValueTypes.STRING;\n  }\n  if (!Array.isArray(value)) {\n    throw new Error(`Unhandled value type: ${JSON.stringify(value)}`);\n  }\n  const valueArr = /** @type {Array<*>} */(value);\n  const onlyNumbers = valueArr.every(function(v) {\n    return typeof v === 'number';\n  });\n  if (onlyNumbers) {\n    if (valueArr.length === 3 || valueArr.length === 4) {\n      return ValueTypes.COLOR | ValueTypes.NUMBER_ARRAY;\n    }\n    return ValueTypes.NUMBER_ARRAY;\n  }\n  if (typeof valueArr[0] !== 'string') {\n    throw new Error(`Expected an expression operator but received: ${JSON.stringify(valueArr)}`);\n  }\n  const operator = Operators[valueArr[0]];\n  if (operator === undefined) {\n    throw new Error(`Unrecognized expression operator: ${JSON.stringify(valueArr)}`);\n  }\n  return operator.getReturnType(valueArr.slice(1));\n}\n\n/**\n * Checks if only one value type is enabled in the input number.\n * @param {ValueTypes|number} valueType Number containing value type binary flags\n * @return {boolean} True if only one type flag is enabled, false if zero or multiple\n */\nexport function isTypeUnique(valueType) {\n  return Math.log2(valueType) % 1 === 0;\n}\n\n/**\n * Context available during the parsing of an expression.\n * @typedef {Object} ParsingContext\n * @property {boolean} [inFragmentShader] If false, means the expression output should be made for a vertex shader\n * @property {Array<string>} variables List of variables used in the expression;

There are two types of shaders:\n *\n *   Vertex shaders are used to manipulate the position and attribute of *vertices* of rendered primitives (ie. corners of a square).\n *   Outputs are:\n *\n *   * `gl_Position`: position of the vertex in screen space\n *\n *   * Varyings usually prefixed with `v_` are passed on to the fragment shader\n *\n *   Fragment shaders are used to control the actual color of the pixels drawn on screen. Their only output is `gl_FragColor`.\n *\n *   Both shaders can take *uniforms* or *attributes* as input. Attributes are explained later. Uniforms are common, read-only values that\n *   can be changed at every frame and can be of type float, arrays of float or images.\n *\n *   Shaders must be compiled and assembled into a program like so:\n *   ```js\n *   // here we simply create two shaders and assemble them in a program which is then used\n *   // for subsequent rendering calls\n *   const vertexShader = new WebGLVertex(VERTEX_SHADER);\n *   const fragmentShader = new WebGLFragment(FRAGMENT_SHADER);\n *   const program = this.context.getProgram(fragmentShader, vertexShader);\n *   helper.useProgram(this.program);\n *   ```\n *\n *   Uniforms are defined using the `uniforms` option and can either be explicit values or callbacks taking the frame state as argument.\n *   You can also change their value along the way like so:\n *   ```js\n *   helper.setUniformFloatValue('u_value', valueAsNumber);\n *   ```\n *\n * ### Defining post processing passes\n *\n *   *Post processing* describes the act of rendering primitives to a texture, and then rendering this texture to the final canvas\n *   while applying special effects in screen space.\n *   Typical uses are: blurring, color manipulation, depth of field, filtering...\n *\n *   The `WebGLHelper` class offers the possibility to define post processes at creation time using the `postProcesses` option.\n *   A post process step accepts the following options:\n *\n *   * `fragmentShader` and `vertexShader`: text literals in GLSL language that will be compiled and used in the post processing step.\n *   * `uniforms`: uniforms can be defined for the post processing steps just like for the main render.\n *   * `scaleRatio`: allows using an intermediate texture smaller or higher than the final canvas in the post processing step.\n *     This is typically used in blur steps to reduce the performance overhead by using an already downsampled texture as input.\n *\n *   The {@link module:ol/webgl/PostProcessingPass~WebGLPostProcessingPass} class is used internally, refer to its documentation for more info.\n *\n * ### Binding WebGL buffers and flushing data into them\n *\n *   Data that must be passed to the GPU has to be transferred using {@link module:ol/webgl/Buffer~WebGLArrayBuffer} objects.\n *   A buffer has to be created only once, but must be bound every time the buffer content will be used for rendering.\n *   This is done using {@link bindBuffer}.\n *   When the buffer's array content has changed, the new data has to be flushed to the GPU memory; this is done using\n *   {@link flushBufferData}. Note: this operation is expensive and should be done as infrequently as possible.\n *\n *   When binding an array buffer, a `target` parameter must be given: it should be either {@link module:ol/webgl.ARRAY_BUFFER}\n *   (if the buffer contains vertices data) or {@link module:ol/webgl.ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER} (if the buffer contains indices data).\n *\n *   Examples below:\n *   ```js\n *   // at initialization phase\n *   const verticesBuffer = new WebGLArrayBuffer([], DYNAMIC_DRAW);\n *   const indicesBuffer = new WebGLArrayBuffer([], DYNAMIC_DRAW);\n *\n *   // when array values have changed\n *   helper.flushBufferData(ARRAY_BUFFER, this.verticesBuffer);\n *   helper.flushBufferData(ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, this.indicesBuffer);\n *\n *   // at rendering phase\n *   helper.bindBuffer(ARRAY_BUFFER, this.verticesBuffer);\n *   helper.bindBuffer(ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, this.indicesBuffer);\n *   ```\n *\n * ### Specifying attributes\n *\n *   The GPU only receives the data as arrays of numbers. These numbers must be handled differently depending on what it describes (position, texture coordinate...).\n *   Attributes are used to specify these uses. Use {@link enableAttributeArray_} and either\n *   the default attribute names in {@link module:ol/webgl/Helper.DefaultAttrib} or custom ones.\n *\n *   Please note that you will have to specify the type and offset of the attributes in the data array. You can refer to the documentation of [WebGLRenderingContext.vertexAttribPointer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/vertexAttribPointer) for more explanation.\n *   ```js\n *   // here we indicate that the data array has the following structure:\n *   // [posX, posY, offsetX, offsetY, texCoordU, texCoordV, posX, posY, ...]\n *   helper.enableAttributes([\n *     {\n *        name: 'a_position',\n *        size: 2\n *     },\n *     {\n *       name: 'a_offset',\n *       size: 2\n *     },\n *     {\n *       name: 'a_texCoord',\n *       size: 2\n *     }\n *   ])\n *   ```\n *\n * ### Rendering primitives\n *\n *   Once all the steps above have been achieved, rendering primitives to the screen is done using {@link prepareDraw}, {@link drawElements} and {@link finalizeDraw}.\n *   ```js\n *   // frame preparation step\n *   helper.prepareDraw(frameState);\n *\n *   // call this for every data array that has to be rendered on screen\n *   helper.drawElements(0, this.indicesBuffer.getArray().length);\n *\n *   // finalize the rendering by applying post processes\n *   helper.finalizeDraw(frameState);\n *   ```\n *\n * For an example usage of this class, refer to {@link module:ol/renderer/webgl/PointsLayer~WebGLPointsLayerRenderer}.\n *\n *\n * @api\n */\nclass WebGLHelper extends Disposable {\n  /**\n   * @param {Options=} opt_options Options.\n   */\n  constructor(opt_options) {\n    super();\n    const options = opt_options || {};\n\n    /** @private */\n    this.boundHandleWebGLContextLost_ = this.handleWebGLContextLost.bind(this);\n\n    /** @private */\n    this.boundHandleWebGLContextRestored_ = this.handleWebGLContextRestored.bind(this);\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {HTMLCanvasElement}\n     */\n    this.canvas_ = document.createElement('canvas');\n    this.canvas_.style.position = 'absolute';\n    this.canvas_.style.left = '0';\n\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {WebGLRenderingContext}\n     */\n    this.gl_ = getContext(this.canvas_);\n    const gl = this.getGL();\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {!Object<string, BufferCacheEntry>}\n     */\n    this.bufferCache_ = {};\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {WebGLProgram}\n     */\n    this.currentProgram_ = null;\n\n    assert(includes(getSupportedExtensions(), 'OES_element_index_uint'), 63);\n    gl.getExtension('OES_element_index_uint');\n\n    this.canvas_.addEventListener(ContextEventType.LOST, this.boundHandleWebGLContextLost_);\n    this.canvas_.addEventListener(ContextEventType.RESTORED, this.boundHandleWebGLContextRestored_);\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {import(\"../transform.js\").Transform}\n     */\n    this.offsetRotateMatrix_ = createTransform();\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {import(\"../transform.js\").Transform}\n     */\n    this.offsetScaleMatrix_ = createTransform();\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {Array<number>}\n     */\n    this.tmpMat4_ = create();\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {Object.<string, WebGLUniformLocation>}\n     */\n    this.uniformLocations_ = {};\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {Object.<string, number>}\n     */\n    this.attribLocations_ = {};\n\n    /**\n     * Holds info about custom uniforms used in the post processing pass.\n     * If the uniform is a texture, the WebGL Texture object will be stored here.\n     * @type {Array<UniformInternalDescription>}\n     * @private\n     */\n    this.uniforms_ = [];\n    if (options.uniforms) {\n      for (const name in options.uniforms) {\n        this.uniforms_.push({\n          name: name,\n          value: options.uniforms[name]\n        });\n      }\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * An array of PostProcessingPass objects is kept in this variable, built from the steps provided in the\n     * options.
